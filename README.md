# ledger-app-hns

This is a key management application for the Handshake Protocol. With support
for Ledger Nano S, Nano X and Nano S+, it allows users to create extended public
keys, addresses, and signatures for valid Handshake transactions. It can be used
with the [hsd-ledger][hsd-ledger] client library to interact with wallet
software.

This document serves as an overview of the relevant technical and licensing
details for this application. For more general information on developing for
Ledger personal security devices please read the official Ledger developer
documentation [here][ledger].

For a walk-through of a Ledger application, check out the [nanos-app-sia][sia]
project. The Nebulous Inc. developers have done a wonderful job of documenting
both the high-level architecture and low-level implementation details of Nano S
app development.

## Usage

See [Install](docs/install.md) for instructions on building and loading the app.

## Tests

A suite of tests have been added to the [client library][tests]. They include
device tests with mocked transaction data, and end-to-end tests involving an
active, `hsd` node. All tests require a Ledger Nano S configured with the
following test seed:

```
abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon
abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about
```
